**Do not automatically make bash scripts executable.**

When creating or modifying bash scripts (`.sh` files), do not run `chmod +x` or any other commands to make them executable. The user will handle file permissions themselves.

## What NOT to do:
- Do not run `chmod +x script.sh`
- Do not run `chmod 755 script.sh`
- Do not run any permission-changing commands on script files
- Do not suggest making scripts executable

## What to do instead:
- Simply create the script file with the appropriate content
- Let the user handle file permissions as they see fit
- Focus only on the script content and functionality

This rule applies to all shell scripts including but not limited to:
- `.sh` files
- `.bash` files
- Any executable script files

The user prefers to manage file permissions manually.
