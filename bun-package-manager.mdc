# Package Manager Configuration

- Always use `bun` for package management tasks.
- Do not use `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm` under any circumstances.

## Installation

To install dependencies, run:

```bash
bun install
````

## Adding Packages

To add a package, use:

```bash
bun add <package-name>
```

For development dependencies:

```bash
bun add -d <package-name>
```

## Running Scripts

To run scripts defined in `package.json`, use:

```bash
bun run <script-name>
```

For example, to start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Notes

* Ensure that `bun` is installed and available in your system's PATH.
* This rule applies to all files in the project.
